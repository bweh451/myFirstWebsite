## Discription:
This is the first real website I have ever built. It is a recipe site where you can find the ultimate recipes of everyday food items.
This project enabled me to succesfully use and learn more about HTML SCSS and Javascript. I used jQuery for all the animations, hiding and showing functions and sliding functions. I paired jQuery with JSON for all the "save for later" elements. I created a functional "save for later" page as well where you can view the elements you have saved.

## Installation:
All you have to do is download all the files and folders from the repository and leave them as is. You can open the index.html page inside of your web browser (just drag and drop the file into one of your browser's windows) to be able to view and enjoy the website.

## Usage: 
###### Once the website has opened you can check out all the animations that there are. In the navigation bar there is a dropdown menu that will enable you to navigate to the other webpages on the website.

###### There are a bunch of "save for later" buttons. Once clicked on, it will tell you how many saved items you have in your folder.

###### When you try and click on the same item it will tell you that you have already saved that item.

###### The count of the "save for later" function will stay the same across all pages for example: if you have save a file on the home page and the count is one, and you want to save another element on the recipe page it will add that count to the total, being two.

###### On the second page there is a "user comments" section where you can hide and show the user comments by pressing the "Hide" and "Show" buttons.

###### Similar thing with the actual "Leave a comment". Clicking the "Slide Up" and "Slide Down" buttons, it will make that section slide up and down.

###### To see all the elements that you have saved just navigate to the "save for later" page.

###### Other than that, my website is fully responsive, so it will work on any screen size.
